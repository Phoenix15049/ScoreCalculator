# ScoreCalculator

My first program written with C# (dude , this program was written around 2015 or 14 in .net 4, so donâ€™t expect anything fancy )


The only thing this program gives is that it makes the calculation of scores easier for you.
Along with that, there are some simple mathematical calculation tools that you can use.
